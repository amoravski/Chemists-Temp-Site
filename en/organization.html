				<h3>Basic organization of the project</h3>
				<h4>Institute of Chemical Engineering at Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</h4>
				<p>The applying base organization of the project is <a href="https://iche.bas.bg/" target="_blank">Institute of Chemical Engineering at Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (IChE-BAS)</a>, founded by the Order No. 38/30.10.1986 of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria (State Gazette No. 87, p. 6, 4509, 1986). There is no partner organization for the project, instead we formed the project team on the model of the Max-Planck Institutes, bringing in established specialists from fields where there are no BO specialists, but with whom we have established good project practices and joint previous publication activity.</p>
				<p><a href="https://iche.bas.bg/" target="_blank">IChE-BAS</a> is a major centre for research in the field of chemical engineering and biotechnology. It includes 3 research laboratories - "Process system engineering", "Transfer Processes in Multiphase Media" and "Chemical and Biochemical Reactors".</p>
				<p><a href="https://iche.bas.bg/" target="_blank">IChE-BAS</a> has a long-term experience in:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Development of methods, devices and technologies for replacement of non-renewable raw materials and energy resources with renewable bio-resources and other renewable natural resources;</li>
					<li>Training of qualified personnel in different fields and levels of competence;</li>
					<li>Implementation in industry - more than 20 scientific developments with environmental and energy-saving effect.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>During the last years, <a href="http://iche.bas.bg/" target="_blank">IChE-BAS</a> has also been involved in three projects of national importance:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>National Science Infrastructure Roadmap (2017-2023), Contract DO1-160/28.08.2018 Scientific Infrastructure "Energy Storage and Hydrogen Energy" (NI CEVE);</li>
					<li>National Scientific Program Low-Carbon Energy for Transport and Household, DO1-214/19.11.18;</li>
					<li>"Centre of Competence HITMOBIL - Technologies and Systems for Clean Energy Generation, Storage and Consumption". We also have active participation and approved for funding participants (9 people) in the 2018-2021 Young Scientists and Postdoctoral Fellows NRP.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Scientific results of <a href="http://iche.bas.bg/" target="_blank">IChE-BAS</a> are well known both at national and international level. Publication activity for the last 5 years varies between 40-50 scientific articles per year, of which on average about 28 are in journals with impact factor and SJR, and the citations recorded for the period 2015-2019 exceed 3900. For 2020, 66 (38 in IF / SJR journals) publications were realized and the number of citations was 955.</p>
