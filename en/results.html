				<h3>Expected Results from the Project</h3>
				<p>All of the expected results of this fundamental research are specifically targeted and oriented towards obtaining and disseminating new knowledge and optimal solutions for combined loaded three-layer nanocomposites, among the scientific community and the public. </p>
				<p>The expected results from <a href="package1.html">Work Package 1</a>  will provide a new powerful theoretical tool for rapid prediction regarding the stress-strain state of a three-layer nanocomposite under combined loading. The analytical model solutions for the two-dimensional stresses and strains are easily and quickly calculated (within a few seconds). This will save the conduct of expensive and labour-intensive experiments, as well as open new avenues in theoretical studies of three-layer nanocomposites.</p>
				<p>Also, the anticipated results of <a href="package2.html">Work Package 2</a> will provide valuable information to engineers on the design, material selection, and effective use (without failure) of three-layer nanocomposites under combined loading. For example, in the use of three-layer nanocomposites as materials, components and parts of various devices in microelectronics, in dentistry and surgery, in automotive and aerospace, in smart devices, sensors and many others.</p>
